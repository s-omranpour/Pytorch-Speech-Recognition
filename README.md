#  Speech Recognition 

This is a simple implementation of the paper [STATE-OF-THE-ART SPEECH RECOGNITION USING MULTI-STREAM SELF-ATTENTION WITH DILATED 1D CONVOLUTIONS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00716v1.pdf) in pytorch. Please visit `main.ipynb` for training and inference details.



## Features
 - Using pytorch_lightning as the training backbone
 - Using the popular Librispeech dataset
 - Modules written in pure pytorch
